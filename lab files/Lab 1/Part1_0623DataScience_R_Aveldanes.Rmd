## Section 1: Navigating RStudio

By default, this RMarkdown file will open in the upper left pane of RStudio. You can open a new script by clicking File --> New File --> R Script.

Most of the time, RStudio will be organized in the following four panes:

1. Script (upper left): This is where you view and edit most files, such as scripts, RMarkdown notebooks, etc.
2. Console (lower left): You can use this to enter R commands on the fly. Furthermore, most R output will appear here.
3. Global Environment (upper right): Saved variables, functions, and other R objects will appear here.
4. Misc (lower right): A variety of other tabs which allow you to navigate your file system, view plots, install packages, view help, etc.

RStudio also has a lot of helpful customizations to improve your experience:

Click Tools --> Global Options --> Appearance to change your color and font settings.
Click Tools --> Global Options --> Code and check the box that says "Soft-wrap R source files" to wrap the text in your script to the width of the script pane.
Click Tools --> Global Options --> Code --> Display and check the boxes that say "Highlight selected line" and "Highlight R function calls". These will provide helpful highlighting as you edit your files.

## Section 2: Variable Assignment

Try assigning the value "5" to the variable 'number' and then run 'number'.

To run a line of code, place your cursor on a line of runnable code and click the "Run" button or click Ctrl + Enter (PC) or command + Enter (Mac).

```{r}
number <- 5
number
```

You can also use the '=' operator to do variable assignment. 
```{r}
number = 5
number
```


There are subtle differences between '<-' and '=', which won't matter in most cases. However, using '<-' is considered good code style. You want your code to adhere to good stylistic practices, since that makes it easier to read and use by other users.

You can perform basic arithmetic in R:

```{r}
number + 1
number - 2
number * 3
number / 4
```

Use a hashtag *#* to comment your code (e.g., write notes to your future self and your collaborators) to help keep your script organized. 

Press Ctrl + l on both Mac and PC to clear your console. This does not erase any data. It simply moves the console prompt (the greater-than symbol: >) up to the top to improve readability. 

## Section 3: Functions and Arguments

Functions perform actions on inputs. They are followed by trailing round parentheses.

Arguments are the inputs - values, expressions, text, entire datasets, etc. You tell a function what arguments it needs inside the parentheses. Sometimes, these arguments are "named". This is helpful when you need to enter multiple arguments: the names tell R which arguments correspond to what variables you're passing into the function.

Use the ls() function to see all of the variables you have defined. Notice that ls() does not take any arguments!

```{r}
ls()
```

You can use the "TAB" key to autocomplete a variable.
Place your cursor after the 'b' in 'numb' below and press TAB.
This works for variables and functions alike.

```{r}
number
```

Place your cursor after the 'e' in 'me' below and press TAB
Notice how you can get the mean() function 

```{r}
mean()
```

Variables will be overwritten if you redefine them. What happens to "UC Berkeley" when you run this code?

```{r}
welcome <- "UC Berkeley" 
welcome

welcome <- "Social Sciences Building"
welcome
```


Try saving new values as new variables:
```{r}
welcome2 <- "UC Davis"
welcome2
```

The class() function tells the data class/type of the variable and requires one argument.

```{r}
class(welcome2)
ls()
```

rm() will remove a variable

```{r}
rm(welcome)
ls()
welcome # Error

## Remove all variables with rm(list = ls()).
## Notice that this is the first function we're using with a named argument!
## Or, click the broom icon at top of 'Environment' pane.
rm(list = ls()) 
ls()
```

If we look at the documentation for rm(), we see a '...' for the first argument. This means we simply provide it all the variables we'd like to remove.

```{r}
?rm
## Let's see this in action:
var1 <- 1
var2 <- 2
var3 <- 3
ls()
rm(var1, var2)

## What variables are left?
ls()
## Finish removing all variables:
rm(list = ls())
```


### Challenge 1: Variable Assignment

Define three variables and then write a mathematical expression using only those variables.

```{r}
## Define variables 
num1 <- 2
num2 <- 4
num3 <- 6
ls()

## Expression

ans <- (num3 + num2) / num1
ans

## clear list
rm(list = ls())
```

## Section 4: Data Classes and Coercion

There are five main classes of data we will work with in this workshop:
1. numeric: decimals (the default for ALL numbers in R).
2. integer: whole numbers (positive and negative, including zero).
3. character: text strings (always wrapped in quotations).
4. logical: TRUE or FALSE (1 or 0).
5. factor: nominal or ordinal categorical type.

### Section 4.1: Numerics

Assign 5 to 'number' and check its class. 

```{r}
number <- 5
number
class(number)
```

### Section 4.2: Integers
Coerce 'number' to integer type with the as.integer() function:

```{r}
number_int <- as.integer(number)
number_int
class(number_int)
```


### Section 4.3: Characters
Define welcome <- "Welcome to the D-Lab" and check its class:

```{r}
welcome <- "Welcome to the D-Lab"
class(welcome)
ls()

## Single and double quotes work similarly:
contraction <- 'I am hungry.'
contraction

contraction <- "I am hungry."
contraction
```

You can nest single quotes inside of double quotes:
```{r}
contraction <- "I'm hungry"
contraction
```

Or, you can use all single quotes along with escape characters:

```{r}
contraction <- 'I\'m hungry'
contraction
```
However, you cannot nest single quotes inside of single quotes.

### Section: 4.4 Logicals

Logical data will check to see if a condition is TRUE (1) or FALSE (0).

```{r}
class(TRUE)
class(FALSE)

## Since TRUE and FALSE are stored as 1 and 0, they take on mathematical properties:
TRUE + 2
FALSE - 4
```

Boolean data types evaluate whether a statement is TRUE. Check the following:

```{r}
FALSE < TRUE # less than
TRUE >= TRUE # greater than or equal to
FALSE == FALSE # equivalent to (equal to)
"Mac" == "mac" # R is case sensitive
FALSE != FALSE # not equivalent to (not equal to)
"PC" != "Windows"

## Boolean 'and' (all conditions must be satisfied):
TRUE & TRUE 
TRUE & FALSE

## Boolean "or" (just one condition must be satisfied):
TRUE | TRUE 
TRUE | FALSE
```


### Section 4.5: Factors

A factor variable is a set of categorical or ordinal values. To create a factor variable, we first need a vector. We'll return to factors in the next section after we've learned about vectors.

### Challenge 2: Data type coercion
Like as.integer, other "as dot" functions exist as well, such as as.numeric, as.character, as.logical, and as.factor.

1. Define three variables: one numeric, one character, and one logical

```{r}
num <- 3
class(num)
char <- "Hi"
class(char)
logic <- TRUE
class(logic)
```

2a. Can you convert numeric to integer type?

```{r}
num_int <- as.integer(num)
num_int
class(num_int)
```

2b. Convert numeric to logical?

```{r}
num_logic <- as.logical(num)
num_logic
class(num_logic)
```

2c. Convert numeric to character?

```{r}
num_char <- as.character(num)
num_char
class(num_char)
```

2d. Convert logical to character?

```{r}
logic_char <- as.character(logic)
logic_char
class(logic_char)
```

2e. Convert character to numeric?

```{r}
char_num <- as.numeric(char)
char_num
class(char_num)
```

## Section 5: Data Structures

There are four main functions you can use to form more complex data structures:
1. c(): ordered groupings of the SAME type of data (called "vectors").
2. data.frame(): and ordered group of equal-length vectors; also like a list.
3. list(): store heterogeneous data.
4. matrix(): like a vector, but can be ordered into rows and columns.

Helpful tip: Type a question mark before a function name to view the help pages. Read the "Description" section for a definition. The "Usage" section shows what arguments can be passed into the function and the "Arguments" section provides definitions of the individual parameters/arguments. Also see the "Details", "References", and "Examples" sections for more information.

### Section 5.1: Vectors
A vector is an ordered group of the *same* type of data. We can we can create vectors by concatenating data together with the c() function:

```{r}
vec <- c(2, 5, 8, 11, 14)
vec
```

We can also store missing values in a vector using the NA keyword:

```{r}
vec <- c(2, 5, 8, NA, NA)
vec

# View the help page for the arithmetic mean function:
?mean

mean(vec, na.rm = FALSE) # Does not work due to missing data.

mean(vec, na.rm = TRUE) # Works properly. 

(2 + 5 + 8) / 3 # Do it manually! (sanity check)
```


It does not matter what type the data is contained within the vector, as long as it is all the same:

```{r}
numeric_vector <- c(234, 31343, 78, 0.23, 0.0000002)
numeric_vector
class(numeric_vector)
length(numeric_vector) # There are five elements in this vector.
```


To index a vector means to extract an element based on its position. For example, if we want to return just the third thing from "numeric_vector", we would use square brackets and type:

```{r}
numeric_vector[3]
class(numeric_vector[3])

## We can also add items to a vector using another c() function:
numeric_vector2 <- c(numeric_vector, c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3))
numeric_vector2

```

We can use the seq() function to create a vector according to a sequence:

```{r}
?seq
sequence <- seq(from = 0, to = 8, by = 1)
sequence

decimals <- seq(from = 0, to = 2, by = 0.25)
decimals

## Extract just the 4th element:
decimals[4]

## When we want a numeric vector with entries separated by 1, we can also use the colon operator: 
0:8

colon_vector <- c(28:36)
colon_vector 

0:length(colon_vector)
```

Vectors can contain other types, too. Consider the following examples:

```{r}
character_vector <- c("Canada", "United States", "Mexico")
character_vector
class(character_vector)

logical_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
logical_vector
class(logical_vector)
```

R also provides the operator `%in%` to test if a value belongs to a vector.

```{r}
TRUE %in% logical_vector
"Canada" %in% character_vector
26 %in% colon_vector

## The %in% operator can be very useful if you have multiple elements that you want to check. 
c(29, 31) %in% colon_vector
c("Canada", "Ethiopia") %in% character_vector
```


### Challenge 3: Concatenating vectors

1. Create a vector starting from 10, and ending with 30, with each entry separated by 2.

```{r}
num_vector <- seq(from = 10, to = 30, by = 2)
num_vector
```

2. Index the 3rd through 7th elements of this vector.

```{r}
num_vector[3:7]
```

3. Index the 3rd through 7th elements and the 10th element.

```{r}
num_vector[3:7]
```

### Section 5.2: Factors (interlude)

Remember above when we talked about factors are how R refers to categorical data? Categorical data can be important when you are performing calculations or making visualizations by group. This way, R knows that the numeric or character data should have grouping properties.

"Levels" are the groups contained within the factor variable itself.

Let's create a vector of countries. We'll assume that our dataset will only refer to these three countries, i.e., they're categorical values:

```{r}
countries <- c("Canada", "Mexico", "United States", "Mexico", "Canada")

## We can create a factor using the factor() function:
countries_factor <- factor(countries)
countries_factor
```

Note that factors are *ordered* groupings. Here, R chose the ordering to be alphabetical, by default. We could have specified something else using the "levels" argument:

```{r}
countries_factor <- factor(countries, levels = c("United States", "Mexico", "Canada"))
countries_factor

## Factors can also be created using numeric values:
numeric_factor <- factor(c(1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1))
numeric_factor
```


### Section 5.3: Lists

A list can be used to store heterogeneous data.

Let's include three different data types: logical, character, and integer.

```{r}
list1 <- list(TRUE, "one", 1) 
list1
class(list1)

## Normal arithmetic operates won't work with lists, though:
list1 * list(FALSE, "zero", 0) # Error
```
