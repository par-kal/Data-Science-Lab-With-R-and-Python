## Running Python in Anaconda IDE

It's common to write python programs using either a text editor or an interactive/integrated development environment (IDE). An IDE  is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Some of them come with package managers and other features, too.

There are many Python IDE's. You can see a comparison [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments#Python)


## Jupyter Notebooks

This course will be using a Jupyter Notebook to interact with Python.  The bit of extra setup is well worth it because the Notebook provides code completion and other helpful features.

Jupyter Notebooks are included in the Anaconda distribution which you installed. Notebook files have the extension ".ipynb" to distinguish them from plain-text Python programs.



## Open Jupyter Notebook

1. Open the Anaconda Navigator program on your computer.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook from there.
3. Navigate to the `python-fundamentals-master` folder. Depending on what your home directory is, this most likely mean clicking the "Desktop" folder, at which point `python-fundamentals-master` should be visible.
4. Click on `python-fundamentals-master`.
5. Click on `Day_1`.

This will start a Jupyter Notebook server and open your default web browser.

- The server runs locally on your machine only and does not use an internet connection.
- The server sends messages to your browser.
- The server does the work and the web browser renders the notebook.
- You can type code into the browser and see the result when the web page talks to the server.

This has several advantages:

- You can easily type, edit, and copy and paste blocks of code.
- Tab complete allows you to easily access the names of things you are using and learn more about them.
- It allows you to annotate your code with links, different sized text, bullets, etc., to make it more accessible to you and your collaborators.
- It allows you to display figures next to the code that produces them to tell a complete story of the analysis.
- The notebook is stored as JSON but can be saved as a .py file if you would like to run it from the bash shell or a python interpreter.
- Just like a webpage, the saved notebook looks different than what you see when it gets rendered by your browser.

Let's get programming!
