Storing the "AirPassangers" data set as a object in the R global enviorment
```{r}

AP <- AirPassengers
AP

```

Making a linear regression model for the Passengers data set(EDA #1)
```{r}

autoplot(AP) + labs(x="Time", y ="Passenger numbers ('000)", title="Air Passengers from 1949 to 1961") + theme_classic() + geom_smooth()

```

Making a boxplot for the Passengers data set(EDA #2)
```{r}

boxplot(AP~cycle(AP), xlab="Passenger Numbers(In Thousands)", ylab="Months", col=rgb(0.1,0.9,0.3,0.4), main="Monthly Air Passengers Boxplot from 1949 to 1961", horizontal=TRUE, notch=FALSE)

```

Making a ARIMA(Auto regressive integrated moving average) plot as the final model
```{r}
arimaAP <- auto.arima(AP)
arimaAP
```
